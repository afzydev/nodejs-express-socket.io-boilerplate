A simple boilerplate node.js, express.js & socket.io

I created this repo as I kept making new node.js projects and was copying resources from different places. Eventually things got to spread out and I couldn't figure out which project had the most up to date setup. I've tried to break things out into their respective config/lib files for easier organization.
